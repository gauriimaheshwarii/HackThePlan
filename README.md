## 💡 Inspiration!
We all look out for venues for throwing a party, but cannot seem to get a complete experience of the place while doing so. This website fixes it!

## ⚙ What it does
The website is one-stop-shop for every party planner where they can book the venue, check out the food options nearby, and get the decor as they like.

## 🔧 How we built it
We built it by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 💪 Challenges we ran into
Fixing the 360° view for the page was really difficult, and took us quite some time.

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to make something new and creative to give a wholesome user experience.

## ⏭  What's next for Soiree
Adding an interface to allow the vendors to list themselves on our platform, and polishing the website further.
